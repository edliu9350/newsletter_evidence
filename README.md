# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# Result

To store data, I used JSON, failed to use Sharepoint Online List, 1 or 2 hours more needed for that.

Other requirements have been implemented and tested manually.

Inserted some simple comments for only necessary parts of code.
